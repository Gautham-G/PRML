#### A study project on **Kernel Truncated Randomized Ridge Regression** (KTR-3).
###### * KTR-3 is empirically seen to lower the gap between the upper and lower error bounds.
###### * The algorithm has faster *finite-time* and *asymptotic rates* on problems where the Bayes risk with respect to the square loss.
